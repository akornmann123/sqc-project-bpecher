Usability Goals
===============

Recognize Exclusion and Solve for One, Extend to Many
-----------------------------------------------------

I would like to include alt tags on images on my site to allow for those who are visually impaired to have a description of an image, since they may not be able to see it or see it well. This would utilize the principle of inclusive design by recognizing an exclusion and addressing it. It could also be helpful to those who may not recognize the image by providing additional information about the image. This provides context and utilizes the principle to solve for one, extend to many. An example can be found at the link below where an image doesn't load, but the alt text provides context of what the image is supposed to display.

Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
-------------------------------

I would also like to incorporate the heuristic of aesthetic and minimalist design. I want to take the complexity out of planning a trip as much as possible. There can be a ton of facets that need to be considered like events, transportation, lodging, food, cost, weather, and many others when planning a trip. I want a simple interface that helps the user get the basic information they need and make it easy to perform changes or modifications to those plans. I've found on nearly every trip I have taken that "expect the unexpected" to be true. Making modifications to the plan areas of the site should be easy for the user to complete, and with a minimalist design I think that can be accomplished.

I feel like the following website explains, with very basic concepts, how I want to implement this design.
